# BOB (Be aware of your Own Brain üß†)

Since my recent projects cannot be made publicly available (at least for now), I have decided to create a sample project
that could give some insights regarding my recent work.
In this project, I will write production-ready code - the code that my all other publicly available repositories do not
have.

The goal of the project BOB is to identify valence (positivity üòÇ or negativity üò°) from brain signals. Why? Because we
are on the frontier of technological advances and novel applications will help us to better understand human needs,
behaviour, and decision making.

Stay tuned ü§ì for the updates. The next update is scheduled for **21.04.2024** ‚è≤Ô∏è. 
I will show how to train and serve the models on GKE.

### General setup:
- This project uses Poetry as packaging and dependency management tool
- Please see https://python-poetry.org/ 
- You can run ```poetry build``` to build the source and wheels archives

### Data setup:
- Download data: https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/
- Extract ```data_preprocessed_python.zip```
- Create a folder (I will refer to this folder as PROJECT_FOLDER) and place the extracted data into this folder.

### Current state:
- The script ```split_data.py``` preprocesses the data and splits the data into train/validation/test sets.
- The script ```train_ssl.py``` trains a representation model in a self-supervised way without labels.
- The script ```train_linear.py``` trains a linear model in a supervised way with binary labels (positivity or negativity) on top of the SSL model.
- The script ```train_baseline.py``` trains a baseline model in a supervised way with binary labels.
- The training process can be seen on the W&B (https://wandb.ai/site) dashboard (you need to create an account).

### Next update will include:
- Deploying Kubeflow and Ray on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for smooth training and serving of the models.
- Statistical evaluation of the results achieved by linear and baseline models. Here, we want to evaluate which model
  performs better. For this, statistical significance of results will be reported using p-value and effect size.

This is an open-source project done in my free time. 
I have a full time job, so I will proceed as I have time.
