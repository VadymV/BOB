# BOB (Be aware of your Own Brain 🧠)
Since my recent projects cannot be made publicly available (at least for now), I have decided to create a sample project that could give some insights regarding my recent work.
In this project, I will write production-ready code - the code that my all other publicly available repositories do not have.

The goal of the project BOB is to identify valence (positivity 😂 or negativity 😡) from brain signals. Why? Because we are on the frontier of technological advances and novel applications will help us to better understand human needs, behaviour, and decision making.  

Stay tuned 🤓 for the updates. The next update is scheduled for 02.04.2024 ⏲️.
