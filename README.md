# BOB (Build your Own Brain 🧠)
Since my recent projects cannot be made publicly available (at least for now), I have decided to create a sample project that could give some insights regarding my recent work.
In this project, I will write production-ready code - that my other publicly available repositories do not have.

The goal is to identify valence (positivity 😂 or negativity 😡) from brain signals.

Stay tuned 🤓 for the updates. The next update is scheduled for 01.04.2024 ⏲️.
